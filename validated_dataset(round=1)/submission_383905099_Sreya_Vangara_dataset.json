In those counties, the gap in county-government interview call-backs between applicants with African-American–identifying names and White-identifying names (measured by paired résumé audits run each spring) fell from 12 percentage points to 6 points. Over the same period, in the 24 counties that did not adopt Ban-the-Box, the gap fell from 11 points to 9 points. A policy memo notes that the adopting counties were also the ones that had recently faced DOJ civil-rights investigations or entered consent decrees over discriminatory hiring practices, and they simultaneously increased HR staffing and introduced standardized scoring rubrics and interviewer training. The memo argues the ordinance is the key driver and recommends mandating it statewide.",

However, internal memos note that the program also changed local economic activity: as more people used mobile money, traders shifted from cash to digital payments, which increased agent commissions and attracted more agents; at the same time, the denser agent network made mobile money more convenient, further accelerating adoption. The ministry proposes scaling the subsidy nationwide and forecasts a 6% consumption gain everywhere based on the pilot difference-in-differences estimate.",

After 12 months, the city reports the low-risk share rose from 41% to 63%. Over the same period, emergency-department (ED) visits for pedestrian/cyclist injuries citywide rose from 2,050 to 2,240 (+9%). Internal emails show three operational changes: (1) crews prioritized repainting crosswalks and adding “slow” pavement stencils at intersections already near the low-risk threshold; (2) the DOT reduced the number of loop sensors on arterial roads from 620 to 430 due to “maintenance savings”; and (3) the 311 app was redesigned, and near-miss reporting fell 38% in high-injury corridors.

To estimate the causal effect on true safety, you’d need outcome measures not easily gamed (e.g., independent injury surveillance per pedestrian/cyclist exposure, severity-weighted crashes) and a design that separates metric gaming from real safety changes (e.g., randomized rollout of incentives or auditing/parallel measurement).",

Once rewards depend on the score, managers have incentives to (i) shift effort to places where small, visible changes flip the rating, (ii) reduce or relocate measurement that feeds unfavorable speed inputs, and (iii) alter reporting channels that generate near-miss data. These pathways (Z) can raise the score even if true safety does not improve; the concurrent rise in ED injury visits is consistent with the proxy decoupling from the target.

Therefore, it does not follow that enforcing the cap will causally reduce injuries via the stated mechanism, and the direction of effect could even reverse if conditioning is undermined.",

If everyone’s pay rises together, workers’ rank usually stays the same, and comparisons may simply reset; worse, if the raise compresses differentials between tenure levels or roles, perceived unfairness can increase.

In many workplaces, job satisfaction and retention respond strongly to relative deprivation: workers compare their pay to peers in the same warehouse/role/tenure cohort. The top-quartile workers are not just ‘higher paid’; they are higher ranked within their reference group. A uniform 10% raise keeps most workers in the same pay rank and may not increase perceived status; additionally, if pay bands compress or if differentials (lead vs picker, senior vs junior) are perceived as unfair after the change, satisfaction and turnover may not improve as predicted.

In addition, nationwide deployment faces distribution shift (more aggregator/dealership applicants, higher fraud), which changes error rates and the set of “repay” applicants used by the constraint.

Those 10 teams report more locker-room conflicts (14 formal complaints per 100 player-months vs. 8 on the 14 control teams) and slightly worse fourth-quarter defensive rating (112 vs. 108). The league office proposes a different intervention: keep total payroll the same but compress pay by reducing the spread between highest- and lowest-paid starters (e.g., from a $1,200 spread to a $300 spread) to improve morale and late-game defense.",

    "gold_rationale": "This is a classic ecological fallacy: the memo treats a commuting-zone-level correlation as if it identified the causal effect of raising union membership via policy. High-union CZs may have higher wages because of different compositions—more high-paying industries, higher education levels, larger firms, and higher cost of living—all of which can raise both union density and wages. Even if unions raise wages for union members within a CZ, the aggregate CZ association cannot by itself identify P(Y|do(X)) because it conflates cross-region differences with the within-worker (or within-firm) causal effect of changing union status. To support the policy claim, the analysis would need an identification strategy at the worker/firm level (or a credible natural experiment/RCT) that isolates exogenous changes in unionization from regional composition.",

During the same period, median incomes rose in treated municipalities, shifting the reference point upward; additionally, eligibility defined as a percent of the local median can mechanically preserve or worsen perceived relative rank even as cash rises. Thus, the observed gap can arise because recipients remain (or feel) further behind a rapidly improving peer group or because program labeling increases salience/stigma, not because the extra $120 causes higher stress in a direct harmful way.

Based on this, the state Medicaid agency mandates the same program statewide for 200 clinics (estimated eligible n=85,000) using the existing pharmacist workforce. In the statewide rollout, each pharmacist is assigned about 2,000 patients, calls are shortened to 2 minutes, and only 35% of enrollees receive a call in a given month due to staffing limits.

Hospitalizations can therefore rise even if true infections or severity do not. In addition, shielding can shift exposure toward household/caregiver transmission (exposure substitution), so the policy may not target the actual dominant transmission channel for the high-risk group.

But the program’s mechanism primarily changes behavior and care processes: enrolled high-risk patients receive more monitoring and easier referral pathways, which can increase admissions even if infections fall. Additionally, reducing community contacts can increase time at home, potentially raising household transmission from working family members or caregivers—meaning the intervention may not reduce the dominant exposure source for that group.

To make this counterfactual credible, you’d need a design that identifies Y0 for Ama-like households (e.g., random assignment of loan offers, a sharp cutoff in approval scores enabling an RDD, or a well-specified SCM with validated functional assumptions).",
    "gold_rationale": "The claim asserts an individual counterfactual: Ama’s unobserved profit path without the loan (Y0) would have remained at 320 GHS. But we only observe her treated outcome (Y1=520). Because loan receipt is not random—approval depends on repayment capacity and business stability—Ama is selected on characteristics that also raise profits even without credit (entrepreneurship, demand forecasting, supplier relationships). In addition, time-varying shocks (tomato price changes, rainfall, market-day foot traffic) and alternative financing could explain some or all of the increase. Without a structural model tying these factors to profits or a credible identification strategy (e.g., randomized rollout, regression discontinuity at the interview score cutoff, or an instrument), the individual-level “would have stayed at 320” counterfactual is not supported. The correct conclusion is conditional: the loan may have helped, but the magnitude and even direction for Ama cannot be inferred from her self-report and observed before/after profits alone.",

At best, a regression discontinuity design could estimate a local average effect for students near the 70th-percentile cutoff under continuity and no-manipulation assumptions, but that would still be a local average effect, not Maya’s deterministic outcome. Therefore the board member’s definitive statement about what would have happened to Maya is not supported by the stated information.",

The claim asserts a specific unobserved quantity: how many ED visits Riverbend would have had in 2025 if the advisory had not been issued (Y_{X<-0}). The observed drop (255 to 186) is not that counterfactual difference, because many other factors could change year-to-year (seasonal GI waves, ED access and avoidance, diagnostic coding), and the contamination severity that triggered the advisory may itself be linked to illness risk. The advisory can also change healthcare-seeking, so ED counts may fall even if true infections do not. To support the claim you’d need a defensible counterfactual estimator (e.g., synthetic control / DiD with multiple pre-periods), evidence of parallel pre-trends and no spillovers, and ideally independent measures of true incidence (stool testing, syndromic surveillance outside EDs) plus a model separating ‘reduced exposure’ from ‘changed care-seeking’.",

But the relevant counterfactual is Riverbend’s 2025 ED visits under no advisory, Y_{X<-0}, which is not observed. It could differ from 255 due to (i) different norovirus/rotavirus circulation in 2025 vs 2024, (ii) changes in ED utilization or triage during an emergency (people avoid EDs or shift to urgent care/telehealth), (iii) coding/practices changes, and (iv) the contamination event’s severity/duration, which both prompted the advisory and determines potential illness absent intervention. Pine County is not automatically a valid counterfactual either: it may have different baseline trends, different pathogen timing, and may be indirectly affected by Riverbend news (spillover risk avoidance). Therefore the specific numeric counterfactual claim (“at least 69 prevented ED visits”) does not follow from the provided information. The ground truth is CONDITIONAL because with strong, explicit assumptions (e.g., parallel trends, no spillovers, stable coding, and a model linking advisory to both exposure reduction and care-seeking) a design like synthetic control or difference-in-differences could estimate the counterfactual; but those assumptions are not established here.",

Comparing 40% (treated) to 10% (untreated) is therefore not a valid estimate of that counterfactual; it’s mostly comparing high-risk students to lower-risk students. To support the claim, you’d need a design or assumptions that identify the effect on the treated—e.g., randomized assignment among high-risk students, a credible regression discontinuity at the cutoff with no discretionary overrides, or a longitudinal causal model that adjusts for baseline and time-varying confounding with adequate overlap.",

Formally, the comparison mixes different potential-outcome distributions because X is a function of Z and unmeasured U that also affects Y. Without a credible SCM (or an RCT / quasi-experiment with valid identification) that justifies ignorability given Z, plus positivity (overlap) and correct modeling of time-varying confounding, we cannot infer the sign of the effect on the treated.

In addition, outcomes like default are only observed for approved loans (selective labels/feedback), so the model’s behavior and evaluation can shift when the approval set changes.

Additionally, because repayment/default is only observed for approved loans, the lender’s training and monitoring data are subject to selective-label/feedback effects that can change after deployment; this breaks simple cross-quarter counterfactual comparisons. Identifying the counterfactual gap requires either (a) a randomized or quasi-randomized switch where only the model changes while the funnel is held constant, or (b) a fully specified SCM with assumptions that define which parts of the world are held fixed (applicant pool, completion, economic conditions) and how to transport the model’s decisions across those worlds.

Those data do not identify Marcus’s personal potential outcome under the intervention ‘no criminal-history consideration at any stage.’ To justify the claim you would need a structural model (or very strong assumptions) linking criminal-history review to Marcus’s probability of receiving and retaining a conditional offer, while accounting for unobserved candidate ranking and the reduced number of slots during the freeze. Without that, you can’t move from a group-level gap (15% vs 30%) to a deterministic statement about what would have happened to Marcus.",
    "gold_rationale": "This is an L3 claim about Marcus’s potential outcome under an alternative world. The provided statistics are group-level and conditional on reaching interviews; they do not tell us Marcus’s latent rank among candidates or whether he would have received (or kept) a conditional offer absent criminal-history consideration. Moreover, the hiring freeze changes the number of available slots during Marcus’s window, so even if removing criminal-history consideration increased his probability of advancing, he still might not be hired due to fewer openings. Finally, the ordinance described delays inquiry but does not eliminate post-offer checks; the claim intervenes on a different policy than what was observed. Therefore the statement ‘Marcus would have been hired’ is not supported; at best one could discuss a change in probability under strong, contestable assumptions about (a) how Marcus would rank absent the check, (b) how the freeze interacts with selection, and (c) what disqualifications remain.",

The press release answers an L3 question (what would have happened to the enrollees if they had not enrolled) by plugging in the observed moving rate of non-enrollees. That implicitly assumes exchangeability: that non-enrollees represent the enrollees’ counterfactual world. With voluntary uptake, that assumption is unlikely—unmeasured factors like impending lease end dates, prior intent to relocate, job-search plans, or recent life shocks can influence both enrolling and moving. Those variables open a backdoor path (U → X and U → Y), so P(Y|X=0) is not equal to P(Y_{0}|X=1). Also, new social ties can either anchor people or help them find out-of-town opportunities, so the average counterfactual depends on heterogeneous effects and who chose to enroll. To support the ‘30 moves prevented’ claim, you’d need a design that identifies the counterfactual for enrollees (e.g., randomized encouragement with IV/LATE assumptions, an RCT, or strong adjustment with pre-treatment mobility intent and lease timing plus sensitivity/bounds).",
    "gold_rationale": "This is an L3 counterfactual claim about the enrollees: it asserts a specific value for P(Y_{0}=1 | X=1). The city substitutes the observed 12.2% moving rate among non-enrollees for that counterfactual. That substitution is not justified because enrollment is voluntary and likely depends on unmeasured determinants of moving (lease timing, job search intensity, pre-existing relocation plans, family obligations). Those same determinants affect the outcome, making the non-enrollees non-exchangeable with enrollees. Moreover, plausible program mechanisms cut both ways in sociology of networks: new ties can increase place attachment (lower mobility) but can also expand opportunity sets (higher mobility). Without a design that identifies the counterfactual (randomized assignment/encouragement with valid assumptions, a credible natural experiment, or rich pre-treatment measures plus sensitivity analysis), the claim of \"about 30 moves prevented\" is not warranted as stated. The ground truth is conditional: the claim could be correct under strong assumptions, but those assumptions are not established in the scenario.",

At the same time, the city’s “dynamic pricing” rule adjusted prices each month to target 85% occupancy; because cruising rose, the rule raised prices again in the busiest blocks, and because some drivers diverted to nearby residential streets, the council expanded a residential permit program that reduced non-permit curb spaces by 18%.

A simple pre/post comparison can’t isolate the causal effect of raising prices on cruising, because part of the post-period price level and curb-space changes were themselves caused by earlier cruising. To make a valid causal claim, you’d need a design that holds prices fixed after the intervention or exploits quasi-random variation in prices that is not a function of cruising (or explicitly model the dynamic system).",

The claim treats the meter price as a one-time intervention, but in the scenario the price level evolves endogenously: the dynamic pricing rule raises prices in response to high occupancy/cruising, and the city simultaneously changes curb availability via permits in response to spillovers. That creates a cycle where outcomes influence subsequent treatment intensity (Y → X) and related policies (Y → Z), which then affect Y again. Therefore, the observed increase in cruising after the initial price change cannot be attributed solely to the meter-price increase; it may be driven by the subsequent feedback-driven price hikes and curb-space reductions or by behavioral adaptation.

Because the poverty-index cutoff also drove a feeder-road upgrade (and likely other support) and Lumo had an atypical rainfall shock, the observed 0.8 ton/ha increase cannot be attributed uniquely to vouchers. The correct causal structure is: cutoff → vouchers and cutoff → roads (and other inputs), plus rainfall → yields (and possibly interacts with vouchers). To make the counterfactual credible, you’d need a design that isolates the voucher discontinuity (showing other programs do not jump at 0.60), or a broader counterfactual construction (e.g., synthetic control using many districts with matched pre-trends) and explicit adjustment/modeling for rainfall and co-interventions.",

The report implicitly treats Beka and/or Lumo-2021 as the counterfactual for Lumo-2023 without vouchers. That fails because (i) the poverty-index cutoff also changed other inputs (a feeder-road upgrade and possibly extension services), making treatment “compound” rather than a single intervention; (ii) Lumo had an unusually favorable rainfall shock that directly raises yields and may amplify fertilizer returns; and (iii) equilibrium effects (prices and availability) can differ when coverage changes. Without a credible design that isolates the voucher component—e.g., a sharp RDD that verifies only vouchers jump at 0.60, or a multi-district synthetic control with strong pre-trend fit and no simultaneous policy discontinuities—one cannot conclude that Lumo’s yields would have been 0.8 tons/ha lower absent vouchers. Depending on assumptions (no other discontinuities at the cutoff, stable unit treatment value, and no differential shocks), the claim could become defensible; hence ground truth is conditional, but given the stated co-interventions and rainfall differences, the specific attribution is not supported.",

So the 7-point gap cannot be interpreted as ‘what would have happened to the same retained Algebra-takers’—it conflates a potential treatment effect with policy-induced changes in who enters and stays in the analyzed subgroup. To make a valid counterfactual claim, you’d need an estimand not conditioned on post-treatment variables (e.g., intent-to-treat effect on all 8th graders), or a credible design/model that targets an unobserved principal stratum (e.g., “always-retained, always-Algebra” students) with defensible assumptions about attrition and compliance.",

Shortening visits can reduce these inputs, potentially decreasing true control even if visit volume rises.

However, during the same period, a private developer opened a 420-unit mixed-use complex with 9 new ground-floor businesses on two of the corridors, and the city also expanded a downtown ambassador/security program from 18 to 32 staff who were assigned primarily to those same two corridors.

To support an L3 claim, you’d need a well-specified structural model or a validated counterfactual estimator (e.g., high-quality synthetic control for the corridor plus a micro-level model of victim-offender encounters) and evidence that the resident’s behavior and the offender’s opportunity set would have changed in the relevant way.",

The department also announced that officers who fail review twice in a quarter are removed from patrol for 30 days. In the first 6 months after rollout, the Black-driver stop rate fell from 18.2 stops per 1,000 residents per month to 12.1, while the White-driver stop rate fell from 10.4 to 9.8. A civil-rights advocate points to one particular resident, Marcus, a Black driver who was stopped and searched in March 2024 (two months before rollout) and found with no contraband.

Many causal stories fit the same aggregate decline: the protocol might mainly deter discretionary investigatory stops, while Marcus’s stop could have been for a non-discretionary equipment violation; or the officer involved might have continued stopping under the new paperwork rules. To make this counterfactual credible you’d need a structural causal model or design with stop-level data (reason codes/body-cam coding, officer identity, deployment) and a defensible assumption about how the protocol changes the specific decision that produced Marcus’s stop; otherwise the but-for claim is not warranted.",

Even if the protocol causally reduced stops on average, that does not imply deterministically that Marcus would not have been stopped: the stop could have been based on a clear equipment violation, could have involved an officer who would comply differently, or could have occurred under a hot-spot directive unaffected by the protocol. Because multiple structural models are compatible with the observed aggregate decline—some where Marcus is still stopped under X=1 and some where he is not—the individual counterfactual is not identified. The correct conclusion is conditional: the claim could be supported only under strong, contestable assumptions about how the protocol affects the exact decision node that generated Marcus’s stop and about the absence of concurrent changes affecting the same decision.",

In addition, moving can change downstream supports (new childcare, different clinics, extra caseworker attention), so ‘not moving’ is not a single well-defined alternative unless we specify which post-move supports would still occur. To make a defensible statement, you’d need an SCM (or strong assumptions) and a design that supports estimating Y0(H), such as rich pre-treatment covariates plus a credible model, or bounding/individualized prediction with validated transport assumptions; otherwise, this person-specific counterfactual is not warranted.",

An L3 claim requires a structural causal model specifying which variables are intervened on and which are held fixed across worlds; otherwise Y0(H) cannot be pinned down.

In addition, the firm changed shift-bidding rules in August, creating a co-intervention that could also reduce quits. Observing that Maria stayed (and that quits fell in her role) does not let us conclude she would have quit without the wage increase.

Treatment choice is confounded by unmeasured factors like the actual pathogen/resistance profile and goals-of-care limits (e.g., DNI/DNR), which affect both regimen selection and death risk. And even if you somehow knew the true average causal effect of B, an average effect does not determine Mr. K’s specific potential outcome Y_B.

First, treatment assignment is not randomized; unmeasured factors like pathogen resistance, contraindications, and end-of-life limitations can jointly affect regimen selection and mortality, so even the average causal effect may be biased. Second, even if an RCT established that Regimen B reduces average mortality, that would identify an average effect, not the individual potential outcome for Mr. K. Individual-level counterfactuals require additional structure (e.g., an SCM linking patient features to treatment response) or bounds on the probability of causation; otherwise, Mr. K could belong to a stratum that would die under either regimen, or conversely would survive under either regimen.

To estimate the causal effect of building lanes on individuals’ obesity, you’d need an identification strategy such as following the same residents pre/post, accounting for migration, or using a credible quasi-experiment (e.g., phased rollout with strong parallel-trends evidence) with individual-level outcomes.",
    "gold_rationale": "The claim incorrectly infers an individual-level causal effect from aggregate neighborhood comparisons. High-buildout neighborhoods may differ systematically (higher income/education, better baseline health) and may experience residential sorting after the buildout (more health-conscious residents move in; higher-BMI residents move out), changing obesity prevalence without causing existing residents to lose weight. Because X is measured at the neighborhood level and Y is interpreted at the individual level, the observed group-level difference does not identify P(Y|do(X)) for individuals without a design that tracks the same individuals over time and addresses sorting/composition.",

Once market actors react in advance, 'no station' is not a single well-defined alternative history: would the upzoning still occur, would developers still build, would demand shift elsewhere, and would the comparison corridor still be unaffected? Without specifying and justifying those cross-world invariances (and without a credible method like a well-fitting synthetic control, an RDD around a boundary, or a structural model that accounts for spillovers and anticipation), you cannot validly assert a 25-point reduction in displacement as the counterfactual effect of not building the station.",

Removing the station could change (i) whether upzoning would have passed, (ii) the timing/scale of land assembly and new supply, and (iii) neighborhood desirability and demand spillovers. Because these components are intertwined, the 'no-station' world is under-specified and not uniquely determined. Using a nearby corridor’s 10% rent growth as the counterfactual also assumes away spillovers and assumes parallel trends for both rents and displacement for the same households—assumptions that are contestable and unverified.

From the fact that Maya both received the bonus and retained, we cannot deduce whether her no-offer potential outcome Y0 would have been non-retention.

Therefore, the observed retention advantage among recipients does not identify whether Maya specifically would have failed to retain absent the offer. The claim could be true if (i) the offer causally changed Maya’s job-search/acceptance behavior toward a more stable match or increased persistence during early job shocks, and (ii) we can justify an SCM/identification strategy (e.g., randomized offer with no post-treatment conditioning, or a valid instrument with assumptions plus a model for individual attribution).

After 6 months, the academy’s average HID rises from 8.1 to 10.0 km (+23%).

Those factors can change employment even in the no-tax-holiday world, so the observed treated-vs-untreated difference does not directly reveal the treated firms’ counterfactual Y0. To support the claim, you’d need a credible counterfactual construction for the approved firms (e.g., a quasi-experiment like a sharp eligibility threshold, an instrument, or synthetic control / matched DiD with strong pre-trend evidence and explicit controls for regional demand and credit access).

Approval depends on revenue decline and compliance, and these factors also predict employment changes; additionally, a regional tourism rebound and a subsidized credit expansion (with the same compliance criterion) could independently raise employment among approved firms. If approvals are concentrated in rebounding regions or among firms that could access the new credit line, the observed gains may reflect those shocks rather than the tax holiday. Conversely, if applicants were in deeper distress and would have downsized sharply without relief, the policy could indeed have prevented job losses. Because the untreated counterfactual for the treated group (Y0|T=1) is not pinned down without strong assumptions (e.g., conditional ignorability given measured covariates, valid instruments, or a structural model), the claim is ambiguous and the ground truth is conditional on identification assumptions.",

Additionally, corridor rent growth could be driven by concurrent rezoning, streetscape upgrades, or regional housing demand, so even the neighborhood trajectory without the station is uncertain.

Because moving is a post-treatment choice potentially influenced by the station, the set of 'movers' is not invariant across worlds. The station could also change landlord behavior and the composition of available units, and there may be confounding from concurrent rezoning or regional demand shocks. Therefore the counterfactual is not point-identified; it could be true if the station was the dominant shock and no other major concurrent changes occurred, but it could be false if rents would have risen similarly due to citywide shortages or if movers left mainly due to personal shocks unrelated to the station.",

If completion depends on engagement and underlying trust, and especially if wording influences completion, then the completer-only comparison may not equal the causal effect for the invited population, and it certainly doesn’t identify what would have happened for a particular respondent. Second, even with perfect randomization and no selection issues, moving from an average effect to an individual probability like P(Y_B=Yes | Y_A=No) requires extra structural assumptions (e.g., monotonicity or a fully specified SCM).

That quantity generally cannot be identified from the marginal A/B difference without an SCM and assumptions about (i) whether wording affects completion (S), (ii) whether conditioning on S creates selection bias, and (iii) how individuals’ potential outcomes (Y_A, Y_B) are distributed. If wording changes the likelihood of completing (say B feels easier/longer and affects dropout), then conditioning on completion opens a selection path and the completer-only difference can be biased for the invited population. Even if wording does not affect completion and randomization holds, the individual-level statement still needs assumptions (e.g., monotonicity: no one would switch from Yes under A to No under B) to translate average effects into probabilities for those observed as No under A.

The lender pre-registered two outcome windows: short-term 60-day delinquency and long-term 12-month default. Results: under the new policy, 60-day delinquency decreased from 6.0% to 5.4% overall, but 12-month default increased from 9.1% to 10.0% overall.

Finally, if the program changes employer recruiting or job competition (interference), Maya’s outcome without the program depends on others’ participation.

Even if TechBridge increases employment on average, it does not follow that it was necessary for Maya specifically (probability of necessity). Moreover, the counterfactual is ill-defined unless we specify what replaces TechBridge (no training, different training, more job search, vocational rehab).

The claim could be supported if a near-cutoff design is credible: if students just above and just below 70 are effectively exchangeable, no strategic manipulation of scores occurs, and potential outcomes vary smoothly at the cutoff. Under those assumptions, we could estimate a local average effect for “compliers” around the threshold and then cautiously interpret Maya’s likely outcome.

The lower mortality in the early-treatment group does not justify the individual counterfactual because patients who get early antivirals often presented earlier and were systematically different (frailty, access, baseline risk), and symptom-onset timing is itself uncertain. To support the claim you would need a well-specified structural causal model (or a design approximating randomization of treatment timing), rich time-stamped covariates capturing severity up to treatment, and an estimand for a dynamic regime (e.g., marginal structural models/g-formula) plus assumptions like no unmeasured time-varying confounding and correct measurement of onset time.

Early treatment is not randomly assigned: patients who receive antivirals early may differ systematically (earlier presentation, less frailty, better access, milder disease trajectory). Additionally, symptom-onset time is noisy, and treatment timing is a time-varying exposure affected by prior severity (which is also affected by prior care). The counterfactual 'P would have survived if treated early' could be true if (a) early treatment has a sufficiently large causal effect for patients like P and (b) earlier treatment would not have been accompanied by other changes (e.g., earlier presentation implies different supportive care). It could also be false if P's disease was already on a fatal trajectory by the time early treatment would have been feasible, or if early treatment effect is heterogeneous and small for frail nursing-home residents.

In this setting the counterfactual is especially fragile because (1) patrols can change reporting/detection, so reported burglaries are not a stable proxy for true incidence; (2) crime may be displaced to nearby blocks (interference), so the untreated world is not simply ‘same city minus patrols in these cells’; and (3) the algorithm is updated using post-deployment reports, creating adaptive treatment and time-varying confounding.

Here assignment is also targeted by a risk score (and possibly caseworker discretion), so treated claimants are systematically different from untreated claimants. The 58% vs 66% difference can reflect baseline risk differences rather than program harm, and it still cannot identify Dana’s individual counterfactual. The statement could become defensible only if you had a credible identification strategy (e.g., an RCT, or a clean regression discontinuity with no manipulation and strong continuity checks near 0.70) and then additional assumptions to translate a local average effect into Dana’s personal Y(0).",

Even if the program were beneficial on average for high-risk claimants, Dana could still have remained unemployed without it; conversely, even if it were harmful on average, Dana might have found a job anyway. To make the individual counterfactual credible, one would need a well-specified SCM or a design that approximates random assignment for people like Dana (e.g., a sharp, non-manipulable cutoff with continuity, or an RCT), plus assumptions about compliance and interference. Because these key assumptions and design diagnostics are not provided, the claim is ambiguous and conditionally valid only under additional, contestable assumptions.",

By conditioning on “surviving” to week 8, the sample overrepresents students who could tolerate the program or were improving, so the completer-only association cannot be taken as the association for everyone who enrolled. You’d need outcomes for dropouts (or appropriate missing-data/ITT analyses) to estimate the enrolled-group association.",
    "gold_rationale": "This is a survivorship (attrition) problem: the analysis conditions on completing the program, which is itself influenced by baseline severity and likely by early response to the intervention. Because dropouts are missing week-8 outcomes and had higher baseline stress/anxiety, the reported 10-point reduction among completers cannot be generalized to “students who enroll.” The available data only supports an association among those who remained in the study, not the full enrolled cohort.",

Six months later, the city compared the lottery winners (n=400) to the lottery non-winners (n=600). The overall emergency-department (ED) visit rate fell from 2.4 to 1.6 visits per person among winners, but stayed roughly flat among non-winners (2.3 to 2.2). Importantly, the mix of participants changed: winners had fewer people with severe substance-use disorder (SUD) (30% vs 45% among non-winners) because some high-SUD individuals declined units due to location; the program evaluation reports results both intent-to-treat (by lottery assignment) and treated-on-the-treated (by actual move-in).

Without additional information—pre-trends, a credible control group, a design that handles staggered adoption and spillovers, and evidence separating shipping/demand shocks—the counterfactual Y_{X=0} remains uncertain.

Moreover, emergency food aid and migration income are co-occurring factors that may have prevented an even worse outcome, complicating the ‘no-transfer’ world: removing the transfer might change coping behavior, eligibility for other aid, or migration decisions.

In the policy schools, 1,020 of 1,300 enrolled 9th graders (78%) met this “tested-in-May” criterion; in comparable non-policy schools, 1,140 of 1,250 (91%) did. Among the tested students, 62% passed Algebra I in the policy schools versus 55% in the non-policy schools. The report concludes the policy improved algebra success.",
    "claim": "Because the pass rate is higher among tested students in policy schools (62% vs 55%), the double-period algebra policy is associated with better algebra outcomes for 9th graders overall.",

Baseline academic risk also affects both persistence to testing (Z) and likelihood of passing (Y). Conditioning on survivors/test-takers creates a non-comparable subset: X -> Z <- baseline risk -> Y, so the observed pass-rate difference among survivors can be driven by differential attrition rather than better learning.",

      "answer_if_condition_1": "If key confounders are controlled (e.g., baseline risk, trends, and concurrent interventions) and the assignment mechanism is plausibly exogenous (e.g., via randomization or a valid instrument), then the estimated effect would reflect a causal relationship; otherwise, the estimate reflects association only.",
      "answer_if_condition_2": "If assumptions fail—such as unobserved confounding, reverse causality, or collider bias introduced by conditioning on post-treatment variables—the inference should be treated as non-causal and re-estimated using designs like matching, DiD, or sensitivity analysis."
    },
    "wise_refusal": "NO — this inference is invalid due to SURVIVORSHIP (attrition). You are comparing pass rates only among students who were still enrolled and tested in May. Because the policy schools have substantially more students who did not ‘survive’ into the tested sample (22% missing vs 9% missing), the tested groups are not comparable. If the policy affects transfers, dropouts, or exam participation (or if struggling students are disproportionately missing), the observed 62% vs 55% can arise without any improvement for the original cohort. To support the claim, you’d need cohort-based outcomes (e.g., count non-testers as not proficient or use validated missing-data adjustments) and evidence that attrition patterns are similar across groups or properly modeled.",
    "gold_rationale": "This is a survivorship/attrition problem: the outcome is computed only for students who remained enrolled and took the exam. The policy schools have a much lower tested fraction (78%) than comparison schools (91%), meaning more students are missing from the numerator/denominator in the policy group. If lower-performing or more disengaged students are more likely to leave or miss the exam in policy schools, the remaining tested group will look stronger even if the policy did not improve outcomes for the full cohort. Therefore the association reported among survivors cannot be interpreted as an association for all 9th graders.",
