      "scenario": "In the late 19th century, the Qing Dynasty's Self-Strengthening Movement (1861–1895) aimed to modernize China's military and industry following the Opium Wars. A common historical debate centers on the impact of the 'Zongli Yamen' (the de facto foreign office established in 1861) on China's naval performance. In 1884, the French Navy destroyed the Fujian Fleet at the Battle of Fuzhou. Some analysts argue that if the Qing government had intervened by doubling the annual budget for the Beiyang Fleet specifically in the year 1883 (X), they would have successfully repelled the Japanese naval forces during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 (Y). This claim assumes that a sudden capital injection in 1883 would have been sufficient to bridge the technological and organizational gap by 1894, despite the 'Summer of 1888' naval freeze and the long lead times required for ship procurement, crew training, and dockyard construction (Z).",

      "gold_rationale": "The claim suffers from a significant lag misspecification. While an intervention in 1883 (X) would provide capital, the temporal gap to 1894 (Y) is 11 years. In naval history, the 'shelf life' of cutting-edge technology during the late 19th century was extremely short. Ships purchased with 1883 funds would have been technologically obsolete by 1894, particularly regarding the development of 'Quick-Firing' (QF) guns and higher-speed cruisers which Japan acquired in the early 1890s. Furthermore, the intervention ignores the 'lag' of institutional decay: the 1888 moratorium on ship purchases meant that any momentum from an 1883 budget boost would have dissipated long before the conflict. A one-year budget spike in 1883 does not account for the continuous maintenance and modernization cycles required to win a war a decade later.",

        "answer_if_condition_a": "If the intervention (X) was a sustained annual budget increase from 1883 through 1893, the answer might shift to YES, as it would allow for the purchase of the 'Yoshino' class cruisers that Japan eventually used to win.",
        "answer_if_condition_b": "If the outcome (Y) was the Battle of Fuzhou in 1884, the answer would remain NO because the lag is too short; ships ordered in 1883 could not be built and delivered in time for a conflict one year later."

      "wise_refusal": "I cannot confirm that a single-year budget increase in 1883 would guarantee a 1894 victory, as naval supremacy in this era was a product of continuous technological adaptation rather than a one-time capital investment.",
