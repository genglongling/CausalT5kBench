The r=0.79 correlation exists at the country level, but this doesn't mean individuals who eat more chocolate are more likely to win Nobel prizes. Both variables are driven by national wealth, historical scientific tradition, and development level (Z). Wealthy developed nations have both higher chocolate consumption and long-established scientific institutions. The correlation is compositional—it reflects between-country differences in development, not within-individual causal effects. Switzerland has high chocolate consumption and many laureates, but this doesn't mean eating Swiss chocolate makes you a Nobel laureate. The causal structure is Z→X and Z→Y at the national level. Robinson (1950) demonstrated that ecological correlations can be radically different from individual correlations, sometimes even opposite in sign. Without individual-level data showing that chocolate consumers within countries achieve more, the causal inference is unfounded.",
    "gold_rationale": "The ecological fallacy (Robinson, 1950) occurs when group-level associations are used to infer individual-level causation. Mathematically, the between-group correlation ρ_between can differ substantially from the within-group correlation ρ_within. Here, ρ_between=0.79 for countries, but ρ_within is likely near zero for individuals. The correlation exists because national development (Z) affects both aggregate consumption patterns and scientific infrastructure. This creates a compositional effect: variation between countries in Z drives correlation between X and Y, but variation within countries shows no such relationship. The causal graph at the ecological level is: National Development (Z) → Chocolate Consumption (X̄_country) and National Development (Z) → Nobel Prizes (Ȳ_country). This doesn't translate to individual causation: Chocolate_individual → Nobel_individual. Cross-level inference fails because confounding operates differently at different levels of aggregation. The study would need individual-level data controlling for personal wealth, education, and career to test the causal claim.",

    "wise_refusal": "This is Goodhart's Law: 'When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.' Code review time was originally a reasonable proxy for team efficiency—faster reviews (within reason) suggested streamlined processes. But once managers' bonuses depended on this metric, they had incentive to optimize the metric itself rather than the underlying quality. The result: superficial rubber-stamp approvals that hit the 4-hour target but sacrifice code quality. The metric improved (91% compliance) while the actual outcome deteriorated (35% more production bugs). The causal graph broke: Before: Quality→ReviewTime→Metric, After: Incentive→Gaming→Metric (bypassing Quality). The intervention severed the relationship between metric and outcome. Evidence of gaming: the metric changed dramatically without process improvements, and outcome quality declined. This pattern appears across domains when proxies are incentivized: teaching to the test, hospital mortality gaming by refusing terminal patients, police manipulating crime statistics.",
    "gold_rationale": "Goodhart's Law (1984) states that metrics lose validity when they become targets for optimization. Campbell's Law (1979) similarly notes: 'The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures.' The causal mechanism: (1) Metric M initially correlates with desired outcome Y because both are driven by underlying quality Q: Q→M and Q→Y. (2) Intervention I targets M for rewards. (3) Agents optimize M directly through gaming G rather than improving Q: I→G→M. (4) The G→M pathway bypasses Q, breaking the M-Y correlation. (5) M improves while Y deteriorates. The code review case shows all phases: review time initially proxied efficiency (M∝Q), bonuses targeted review time (I→M), managers gamed with superficial approvals (G→M bypassing Q), metric improved but bugs increased (M↑, Y↓). The solution requires measuring multiple indicators resistant to gaming, or directly measuring outcomes rather than proxies. This is why healthcare moved from process measures (did you document?) to outcome measures (did the patient improve?).",

    "gold_rationale": "AMBIGUOUS. This case lacks sufficient methodological information to determine causality. The scenario describes an association (X correlates with Y) but doesn't provide enough detail about study design, comparison groups, or control variables. Unlike a clear W7 confounding case (where confounders are identified but not controlled), this case is ambiguous because we don't know if it's a within-athlete study (potentially valid) or between-athlete comparison (potentially confounded). The claim could be valid under proper study design or invalid under poor design—we cannot tell from the information provided. More details about the research methodology are needed to make a determination.",
