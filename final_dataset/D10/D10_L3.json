The claim asserts a specific unobserved quantity: how many ED visits Riverbend would have had in 2025 if the advisory had not been issued (Y_{X<-0}). The observed drop (255 to 186) is not that counterfactual difference, because many other factors could change year-to-year (seasonal GI waves, ED access and avoidance, diagnostic coding), and the contamination severity that triggered the advisory may itself be linked to illness risk. The advisory can also change healthcare-seeking, so ED counts may fall even if true infections do not. To support the claim you’d need a defensible counterfactual estimator (e.g., synthetic control / DiD with multiple pre-periods), evidence of parallel pre-trends and no spillovers, and ideally independent measures of true incidence (stool testing, syndromic surveillance outside EDs) plus a model separating ‘reduced exposure’ from ‘changed care-seeking’.",

But the relevant counterfactual is Riverbend’s 2025 ED visits under no advisory, Y_{X<-0}, which is not observed. It could differ from 255 due to (i) different norovirus/rotavirus circulation in 2025 vs 2024, (ii) changes in ED utilization or triage during an emergency (people avoid EDs or shift to urgent care/telehealth), (iii) coding/practices changes, and (iv) the contamination event’s severity/duration, which both prompted the advisory and determines potential illness absent intervention. Pine County is not automatically a valid counterfactual either: it may have different baseline trends, different pathogen timing, and may be indirectly affected by Riverbend news (spillover risk avoidance). Therefore the specific numeric counterfactual claim (“at least 69 prevented ED visits”) does not follow from the provided information. The ground truth is CONDITIONAL because with strong, explicit assumptions (e.g., parallel trends, no spillovers, stable coding, and a model linking advisory to both exposure reduction and care-seeking) a design like synthetic control or difference-in-differences could estimate the counterfactual; but those assumptions are not established here.",

With voluntary uptake, that assumption is unlikely—unmeasured factors like impending lease end dates, prior intent to relocate, job-search plans, or recent life shocks can influence both enrolling and moving. Those variables open a backdoor path (U → X and U → Y), so P(Y|X=0) is not equal to P(Y_{0}|X=1). Also, new social ties can either anchor people or help them find out-of-town opportunities, so the average counterfactual depends on heterogeneous effects and who chose to enroll.

The city substitutes the observed 12.2% moving rate among non-enrollees for that counterfactual. That substitution is not justified because enrollment is voluntary and likely depends on unmeasured determinants of moving (lease timing, job search intensity, pre-existing relocation plans, family obligations). Those same determinants affect the outcome, making the non-enrollees non-exchangeable with enrollees. Moreover, plausible program mechanisms cut both ways in sociology of networks: new ties can increase place attachment (lower mobility) but can also expand opportunity sets (higher mobility). Without a design that identifies the counterfactual (randomized assignment/encouragement with valid assumptions, a credible natural experiment, or rich pre-treatment measures plus sensitivity analysis), the claim of \"about 30 moves prevented\" is not warranted as stated.

In the neighboring district just below the cutoff, Beka (index 0.59), yields rose from 2.0 to 2.2 tons/ha (n=980 farms). However, in 2022–2023 Lumo also received a new feeder-road upgrade (35 km paved) funded by a separate infrastructure program that prioritized the same poverty index, and Lumo experienced 18% higher rainfall than its 10-year average while Beka had average rainfall. The report concludes the subsidy “would have” produced the 0.8 ton/ha gain in Lumo even without the road and weather differences.",

Because the poverty-index cutoff also drove a feeder-road upgrade (and likely other support) and Lumo had an atypical rainfall shock, the observed 0.8 ton/ha increase cannot be attributed uniquely to vouchers. The correct causal structure is: cutoff → vouchers and cutoff → roads (and other inputs), plus rainfall → yields (and possibly interacts with vouchers). To make the counterfactual credible, you’d need a design that isolates the voucher discontinuity (showing other programs do not jump at 0.60), or a broader counterfactual construction (e.g., synthetic control using many districts with matched pre-trends) and explicit adjustment/modeling for rainfall and co-interventions.",

The report implicitly treats Beka and/or Lumo-2021 as the counterfactual for Lumo-2023 without vouchers. That fails because (i) the poverty-index cutoff also changed other inputs (a feeder-road upgrade and possibly extension services), making treatment “compound” rather than a single intervention; (ii) Lumo had an unusually favorable rainfall shock that directly raises yields and may amplify fertilizer returns; and (iii) equilibrium effects (prices and availability) can differ when coverage changes. Without a credible design that isolates the voucher component—e.g., a sharp RDD that verifies only vouchers jump at 0.60, or a multi-district synthetic control with strong pre-trend fit and no simultaneous policy discontinuities—one cannot conclude that Lumo’s yields would have been 0.8 tons/ha lower absent vouchers. Depending on assumptions (no other discontinuities at the cutoff, stable unit treatment value, and no differential shocks), the claim could become defensible; hence ground truth is conditional, but given the stated co-interventions and rainfall differences, the specific attribution is not supported.",

So the 7-point gap cannot be interpreted as ‘what would have happened to the same retained Algebra-takers’—it conflates a potential treatment effect with policy-induced changes in who enters and stays in the analyzed subgroup. To make a valid counterfactual claim, you’d need an estimand not conditioned on post-treatment variables (e.g., intent-to-treat effect on all 8th graders), or a credible design/model that targets an unobserved principal stratum (e.g., “always-retained, always-Algebra” students) with defensible assumptions about attrition and compliance.",

Even if the protocol causally reduced stops on average, that does not imply deterministically that Marcus would not have been stopped: the stop could have been based on a clear equipment violation, could have involved an officer who would comply differently, or could have occurred under a hot-spot directive unaffected by the protocol. Because multiple structural models are compatible with the observed aggregate decline—some where Marcus is still stopped under X=1 and some where he is not—the individual counterfactual is not identified.

In addition, the firm changed shift-bidding rules in August, creating a co-intervention that could also reduce quits. Observing that Maria stayed (and that quits fell in her role) does not let us conclude she would have quit without the wage increase.

To make this claim defensible, you’d need a credible design (e.g., validated RD with no manipulation and known compliance) plus a way to link Maya’s latent characteristics to her individual treatment effect, or a well-specified SCM describing what would change (course access, peers, supports) in the no-acceleration world.",
    "gold_rationale": "This is a counterfactual attribution about a single student’s unobserved potential outcome: Y(Maya, no-acceleration). The cohort gap (72% vs 63%) is an association that mixes selection and treatment effects and does not tell us Maya’s individual effect. Even if a regression discontinuity design were valid near the cutoff, it would identify an average local effect for students near the threshold, not the specific counterfactual outcome for Maya. Moreover, the threshold was not perfectly deterministic in practice (teacher discretion, schedule availability), and acceleration changes multiple mediators (course-taking sequence, peers, tutoring access), making “holding all else equal” ill-defined without specifying what stays fixed in the counterfactual world. Therefore the claim that Maya would not have graduated absent acceleration does not follow from the provided information.",

First, treatment assignment is not randomized; unmeasured factors like pathogen resistance, contraindications, and end-of-life limitations can jointly affect regimen selection and mortality, so even the average causal effect may be biased. Second, even if an RCT established that Regimen B reduces average mortality, that would identify an average effect, not the individual potential outcome for Mr. K. Individual-level counterfactuals require additional structure (e.g., an SCM linking patient features to treatment response) or bounds on the probability of causation; otherwise, Mr. K could belong to a stratum that would die under either regimen, or conversely would survive under either regimen.

The problem is made harder by interference/contamination: some controls received similar assets from another NGO and village-level spillovers could change prices, information, and savings behavior even if Amina were ‘not assigned.’ To justify the but-for claim, you’d need a fully specified structural causal model (or very strong assumptions such as rank preservation/monotonic individual effects and no spillovers) plus evidence those assumptions are plausible.",

Moreover, noncompliance means “assignment” differs from “receipt,” and contamination plus spillovers mean the counterfactual ‘not assigned’ world may still include indirect exposure (e.g., village savings norms, market changes, shared coaching information). Therefore the strong but-for attribution to the program for Amina is not warranted from the provided evidence. At best, one can say the program increased expected profits on average for the study population, and Amina’s outcome is consistent with benefiting, but individual-level necessity is not identified.",

If completion depends on engagement and underlying trust, and especially if wording influences completion, then the completer-only comparison may not equal the causal effect for the invited population, and it certainly doesn’t identify what would have happened for a particular respondent. Second, even with perfect randomization and no selection issues, moving from an average effect to an individual probability like P(Y_B=Yes | Y_A=No) requires extra structural assumptions (e.g., monotonicity or a fully specified SCM).

That quantity generally cannot be identified from the marginal A/B difference without an SCM and assumptions about (i) whether wording affects completion (S), (ii) whether conditioning on S creates selection bias, and (iii) how individuals’ potential outcomes (Y_A, Y_B) are distributed. If wording changes the likelihood of completing (say B feels easier/longer and affects dropout), then conditioning on completion opens a selection path and the completer-only difference can be biased for the invited population. Even if wording does not affect completion and randomization holds, the individual-level statement still needs assumptions (e.g., monotonicity: no one would switch from Yes under A to No under B) to translate average effects into probabilities for those observed as No under A.

A forecast can serve as a counterfactual only if its structural assumptions are correct and if it properly represents the policy-substitution world (what would have happened instead of STW). The scenario leaves critical information missing: whether the model was validated out-of-sample, whether it accounted for firms substituting to wage cuts/temporary contracts, whether there were simultaneous interventions (credit guarantees, eviction moratoria), and whether the effect is merely intertemporal (layoffs shifted to 2021 after the retention window).

But we never observe P both treated early and treated late, and treatment timing is entangled with evolving severity and care-seeking delay (confounding by indication and dynamic confounding). The lower mortality in the early-treatment group does not justify the individual counterfactual because patients who get early antivirals often presented earlier and were systematically different (frailty, access, baseline risk), and symptom-onset timing is itself uncertain. To support the claim you would need a well-specified structural causal model (or a design approximating randomization of treatment timing), rich time-stamped covariates capturing severity up to treatment, and an estimand for a dynamic regime (e.g., marginal structural models/g-formula) plus assumptions like no unmeasured time-varying confounding and correct measurement of onset time. Without those, the counterfactual for P remains conditional rather than settled.",
    "gold_rationale": "The observed lower mortality among early-treated patients does not by itself establish the counterfactual outcome for Patient P under early treatment. Early treatment is not randomly assigned: patients who receive antivirals early may differ systematically (earlier presentation, less frailty, better access, milder disease trajectory). Additionally, symptom-onset time is noisy, and treatment timing is a time-varying exposure affected by prior severity (which is also affected by prior care). The counterfactual 'P would have survived if treated early' could be true if (a) early treatment has a sufficiently large causal effect for patients like P and (b) earlier treatment would not have been accompanied by other changes (e.g., earlier presentation implies different supportive care). It could also be false if P's disease was already on a fatal trajectory by the time early treatment would have been feasible, or if early treatment effect is heterogeneous and small for frail nursing-home residents. Hence the claim is not identifiable from the provided information and is conditional on strong, unverified assumptions.",

Neither identifies Maya’s personal counterfactual because we cannot observe Maya both treated and untreated, and we lack a validated SCM linking schedule/capacity, motivation, alternative supports, and achievement. The claim could be true if (a) receipt were as-good-as-random (e.g., random waitlist or quasi-random tutor-slot allocation) and (b) no meaningful alternative support substituted for the booster; it could be false if Maya would have sought other help, had strong home support, or was placed with a stronger teacher in the no-booster world.
