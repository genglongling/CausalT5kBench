Their lower mortality is therefore at least partly due to better underlying health and access to care, not necessarily the screening procedures themselves.

This is a form of selection bias analogous to the frailty flu-shot paradox: those well enough to attend preventive care are already less likely to die. Proper analysis would adjust for frailty, comorbidities, and healthcare access, or use designs that avoid this selection, before attributing mortality reductions to screening.",

Patients may drop out of the experimental arm due to side effects or early worsening, and drop out of the placebo arm for different reasons, so the subset who remain is not comparable across arms. We should instead use an intention‑to‑treat analysis that includes all randomized patients, regardless of completion, or explicitly model time‑to‑dropout as a competing process. Without that, we cannot reliably attribute the better outcomes among completers to the drug’s true efficacy.",
    "gold_rationale": "Randomization balances prognostic factors at baseline, but conditioning on post‑randomization variables like completion breaks that balance. Completion status is affected by both treatment assignment (e.g., side effects in the experimental arm) and evolving health status, so restricting to completers opens a backdoor path X→Z←Y and induces spurious associations. As a result, the observed difference among completers can be exaggerated, attenuated, or even reversed relative to the true causal effect. A valid estimate of treatment efficacy should be based on intention‑to‑treat or appropriate causal methods (e.g., inverse probability weighting) that account for differential dropout without conditioning on the collider itself.",

The key unmeasured driver is underlying frailty/cachexia, which both shortens survival and can lower CRP because the body can no longer mount a strong inflammatory response. Thus, patients with the very lowest CRP appear to do worst, not because low CRP causes death, but because it signals that they are already near death. The observed positive association between CRP and survival is therefore reverse causation: biological decline (Z) causes both low CRP (X) and high mortality (Y), so intervening on X alone will not improve Y.",

To infer causality, we would need randomized trials or careful longitudinal data that track metabolic status before and after switching sweeteners.",

The naive interpretation treats X→Y, but the true dominant path is Z→X and Z→Y.

To estimate the true causal effect of screening, we would need to compare patients with similar frailty and functional status, ideally using randomized or carefully propensity-matched designs, rather than raw screened vs. unscreened groups.",

Conditioning only on screening status makes it appear that X→Y, when Z1→X and Z1→Y explains much of the association. This is a form of selection bias analogous to the frailty flu-shot paradox: those well enough to attend preventive care are already less likely to die. Proper analysis would adjust for frailty, comorbidities, and healthcare access, or use designs that avoid this selection, before attributing mortality reductions to screening.",
