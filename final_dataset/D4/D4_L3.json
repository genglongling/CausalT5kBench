Given expert estimates that timely diagnosis and treatment would have provided an 80% chance of good recovery versus 35% after the delay, the delay in care plausibly caused a 45 percentage point reduction in his odds of a good outcome. In temporal malpractice cases, causation is appropriately expressed as a loss of chance: the delay harmed him by materially lowering his probability of recovery, regardless of whether he ultimately ended up disabled or not.",
    "gold_rationale": "This scenario uses a temporal counterfactual: comparing the patient's outcome probabilities under two different diagnosis/treatment timings. The relevant causal contrast is P(good outcome | early treatment) = 0.80 versus P(good outcome | delayed treatment) = 0.35, attributable to evolving infarct size as time passes (Z1). The 'cause' here is not that the delay deterministically produced disability, but that it reduced his chance of good recovery by 45 percentage points—the essence of loss-of-chance reasoning. Thus the claim that the delay caused that reduction in probability is a valid counterfactual statement, even though we can’t say with certainty what would have happened in his specific individual trajectory under earlier treatment.",

CPR directly restores minimal but critical circulation (Z1), enabling the patient to remain viable until definitive treatment can reverse the arrest.
