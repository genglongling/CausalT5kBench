When outcomes are aggregated across all risk levels, Ward Y appears to perform worse, but within each stratum of Z (e.g., term, late preterm, extreme prematurity) Ward Y may have equal or better survival than Ward X. The naive comparison ignores Z, so the apparent advantage of Ward X is a statistical artifact rather than evidence of superior care for any particular patient type.",
