The anxiety itself—when optimized—drives hypervigilance and focus that improve performance. Rituals don't cause performance; they're markers of underlying anxiety management. Non-anxious athletes forced to adopt rituals may perform worse due to disrupted routines. The ritual-performance correlation reflects anxiety optimization, not ritual causation.",

Athletes with rituals are selected on anxiety characteristic. Interventions teaching rituals to non-anxious athletes fail because the underlying mechanism (anxiety optimization) is absent. This demonstrates how correlations can reflect psychological markers rather than causal mechanisms.",
