Player C, a defender from Team A, was covering Player B closely and had a chance to intervene but chose not to challenge the foul. Team B subsequently scores from the penalty kick, winning the match. There is debate over whether Player A alone is responsible for conceding the penalty or whether Player C's omission contributed significantly. The rules state that fouls causing penalty kicks are punishable actions, but defensive omissions are not directly penalized unless for misconduct. It is also noted that without Player A's foul, Player B might have taken a shot outside the box, which had a 30% chance of resulting in a goal. Player C's decision not to intervene was deliberate, based on a strategic choice to avoid risking a second foul.\n\nInvariants: The referee would award a penalty only if a foul inside the box occurs; Player C's strategic choice and positioning remains the same; The probability of Player B scoring from open play without the foul is fixed at 30%",

Conversely, if Player C had no realistic intervention option, Player A’s foul remains the primary cause of the goal. The 30% scoring chance from open play means the goal was not guaranteed without the foul. Because the scenario does not specify Player C's realistic options, the counterfactual claim that 'if Player A had not fouled, Team B would not have scored' is underdetermined and depends on these hidden invariants, making the claim CONDITIONAL.",
