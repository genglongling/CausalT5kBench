The economist's selection reflects theoretical priors \\- that market forces matter more than institutions \\- rather than evidence from the data presented. Cross-country evidence undermines the technology/globalization explanation: some countries experienced similar technological advancement and trade openness but had much smaller inequality increases, suggesting institutional factors (unions, labor law, corporate governance) may be decisive.
