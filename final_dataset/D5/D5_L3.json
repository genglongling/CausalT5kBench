    "wise_refusal": "The counterfactual is CONDITIONAL on the causal model of institutional development. Legal origins theory posits that common law creates path dependence toward strong property rights through legal evolution and precedent. Alternative theories suggest that geographic factors, resource endowments, and settler conditions determined both which legal system was adopted and institutional quality—making legal origin a proxy, not a cause. The scenario mentions resources and geography but doesn't resolve whether these were determinative. Empirical evidence is mixed: some studies find persistent legal origin effects, others find effects disappear when controlling for geography.",
    "gold_rationale": "CONDITIONAL on institutional development theory. Path 1 (legal origins): X→institutional evolution via precedent→Y, different X→different Y→claim VALID. Path 2 (endowment theory): Z(resources/geography)→X and Z→Y, X is proxy not cause, different X with same Z→same Y→claim INVALID. Scenario specifies Z present but not whether Z determines Y independently. Need explicit model: Is legal system a cause or marker of deeper determinants? Evidence for both interpretations exists in development economics.",
