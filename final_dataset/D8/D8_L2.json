Code review time was originally a reasonable proxy for team efficiency—faster reviews (within reason) suggested streamlined processes. But once managers' bonuses depended on this metric, they had incentive to optimize the metric itself rather than the underlying quality. The result: superficial rubber-stamp approvals that hit the 4-hour target but sacrifice code quality. The metric improved (91% compliance) while the actual outcome deteriorated (35% more production bugs). The causal graph broke: Before: Quality→ReviewTime→Metric, After: Incentive→Gaming→Metric (bypassing Quality). The intervention severed the relationship between metric and outcome. Evidence of gaming: the metric changed dramatically without process improvements, and outcome quality declined. This pattern appears across domains when proxies are incentivized: teaching to the test, hospital mortality gaming by refusing terminal patients, police manipulating crime statistics.",
    "gold_rationale": "Goodhart's Law (1984) states that metrics lose validity when they become targets for optimization. Campbell's Law (1979) similarly notes: 'The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures.' The causal mechanism: (1) Metric M initially correlates with desired outcome Y because both are driven by underlying quality Q: Q→M and Q→Y. (2) Intervention I targets M for rewards. (3) Agents optimize M directly through gaming G rather than improving Q: I→G→M. (4) The G→M pathway bypasses Q, breaking the M-Y correlation. (5) M improves while Y deteriorates. The code review case shows all phases: review time initially proxied efficiency (M∝Q), bonuses targeted review time (I→M), managers gamed with superficial approvals (G→M bypassing Q), metric improved but bugs increased (M↑, Y↓). The solution requires measuring multiple indicators resistant to gaming, or directly measuring outcomes rather than proxies. This is why healthcare moved from process measures (did you document?) to outcome measures (did the patient improve?).",
