The lab describes the established photochemical mechanism: in sunlight, NOx reacts with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to generate ozone, and higher NOx provides more reactants for ozone formation when sunlight and VOCs are present.\n\nTo test this, the lab used a controlled field setup at one fixed monitoring site next to a major road and ran a series of 12 planned \"exposure windows\" on clear, hot days in July and August. During each window, the lab used the same mobile barrier system to partially divert traffic away from the road segment for exactly 4 hours (12:00-16:00), creating three pre-specified NOx exposure levels at the monitor: no diversion (high NOx), partial diversion (medium NOx), and full diversion (low NOx). The diversion level for each window was set in advance by the lab's schedule and implemented by the same traffic-control team; the monitoring location, instruments, and calibration procedures were unchanged across windows.\n\nThe lab reports that across these windows, sunlight (measured as solar irradiance), temperature, wind speed/direction, and background VOC concentrations were checked and were similar across the three diversion levels because only clear, low-wind days were used and any window that deviated from these criteria was canceled and not analyzed. No other emissions sources near the site changed during the 4-hour windows (no nearby industrial activity, construction, or wildfire smoke events were present, as verified by city logs and satellite smoke alerts).\n\nResults were consistent across windows: average NOx at the site was highest under no diversion, intermediate under partial diversion, and lowest under full diversion; and the 12:00-16:00 average ozone concentration showed the same ordered pattern in the opposite direction (highest ozone under high NOx, lower under medium NOx, and lowest under low NOx). The lab notes that the ozone differences appeared within the same 4-hour windows when NOx differed, matching the expected photochemical timescale.",
    "claim": "Higher traffic-related NOx exposure causes higher ground-level ozone concentrations during summer afternoons at this site.",
    "gold_rationale": "The scenario provides (1) an explicit, well-established mechanism in the text (sunlight-driven photochemistry where NOx participates in ozone formation with VOCs), and (2) a clear dose-response gradient created by planned, graded traffic diversions that generate high/medium/low NOx exposure levels at the same monitoring site. Ozone is measured over the same 4-hour windows and shows a consistent monotonic pattern aligned with NOx dose. Potential alternative explanations are ruled out in the scenario: meteorology (sunlight, temperature, wind) and background VOCs are reported similar across exposure levels due to strict day-selection and cancellations; instruments and location are constant; and other local emission sources did not change during windows. With mechanism + dose-response and controlled stability of other factors, the evidence supports the causal claim that increased NOx causes increased ozone in this setting.",
    "key_insight": "A credible mechanism plus a consistent monotonic dose-response under stable conditions supports a causal interpretation at the association level.",
