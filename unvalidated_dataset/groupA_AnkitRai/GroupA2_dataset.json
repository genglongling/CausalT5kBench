Without knowing whether the Mediterranean diet preceded, coincided with, or followed statin initiation—and without a control group with diet change alone—we cannot say how much of the 40% LDL drop is due to Statin S versus the diet. Any claim that the statin alone caused the full effect ignores this confounding co-intervention.",
          "gold_rationale": "This case illustrates a CONF-MED co-intervention problem: starting Statin S (X) and changing to a Mediterranean diet (Z) both plausibly reduce LDL cholesterol (Y). Because diet change is triggered by the same clinical encounter that leads to statin prescribing, Z is tightly correlated with X, and both X→Y and Z→Y may hold. In such a design, attributing all of the observed LDL decrease to the statin is unjustified; the effect may be partly or largely due to the diet. Proper causal inference would require separating or adjusting for the dietary intervention, for example with randomization, stratification, or a diet-only comparison group.",

Conditioning only on screening status makes it appear that X→Y, when Z1→X and Z1→Y explains much of the association. This is a form of selection bias analogous to the frailty flu-shot paradox: those well enough to attend preventive care are already less likely to die. Proper analysis would adjust for frailty, comorbidities, and healthcare access, or use designs that avoid this selection, before attributing mortality reductions to screening.",

The exposure (screening detection) moves the diagnosis date earlier (lead time), inflating post-diagnosis survival statistics even if the natural course of the disease is unchanged. Additionally, length bias can cause screening programs to preferentially detect slower-growing, less aggressive tumors, further exaggerating apparent survival benefits. Correct causal assessment requires examining all-cause or disease-specific mortality by age, rather than survival conditioned on the (screening-shifted) diagnosis time.",

In late‑stage cancer, low CRP often reflects severe frailty and loss of physiological reserve, which both shortens survival and blunts inflammatory responses. The association between higher CRP and longer survival is therefore driven by underlying robustness, not by CRP itself. Artificially increasing CRP with immune‑stimulating supplements would not correct the underlying frailty and could even cause harm; we would need randomized trials manipulating CRP independent of baseline health to infer a causal benefit.",
          "gold_rationale": "This is a reverse epidemiology/frailty paradox analogous to the cholesterol paradox in nursing homes. The key unmeasured driver is underlying frailty/cachexia, which both shortens survival and can lower CRP because the body can no longer mount a strong inflammatory response. Thus, patients with the very lowest CRP appear to do worst, not because low CRP causes death, but because it signals that they are already near death. The observed positive association between CRP and survival is therefore reverse causation: biological decline (Z) causes both low CRP (X) and high mortality (Y), so intervening on X alone will not improve Y.",
