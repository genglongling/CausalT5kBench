    "scenario": "In the early 1960s, shortly after gaining independence, the Republic of Katamia experienced a significant economic downturn. This period coincided with the assassination of its charismatic leader, President Anzara, who had been a unifying figure for the nation's diverse ethnic groups. Following his assassination, ethnic tensions surged, and political instability ensued, further exacerbating the economic challenges. Analysts often debate whether the continued leadership of Anzara could have steered Katamia through its economic and social crises.",

    "expected_reasoning": "Counterfactual",
    "reference_answer": "While it is tempting to attribute the worsening economic situation and ethnic tensions directly to the assassination of President Anzara, doing so simplifies the complex interplay of historical, economic, and social factors. The pre-existing ethnic tensions and economic vulnerabilities served as significant confounders. These underlying issues might still have led to similar outcomes, albeit perhaps with different dynamics or timelines.",
    "wise_refusal": "Attributing the economic downturn and social unrest solely to President Anzara's assassination neglects the impact of pre-existing ethnic tensions and economic challenges. These factors likely would have exerted significant influence regardless of Anzara's leadership, making a direct causal link overly simplistic and potentially misleading.",

By the early 1990s, nationalist tensions among the republics surged, leading to a series of wars that eventually resulted in the dissolution of Yugoslavia. In an alternative scenario, imagine if Josip Broz Tito, the long-time leader who maintained a strict but stabilizing rule over Yugoslavia, had lived longer, possibly averting the breakup until a different geopolitical climate emerged, such as the expansion of the European Union.",

Tito's leadership style suppressed, but did not resolve, the nationalist tensions. Without addressing these root issues, it’s uncertain whether his longer leadership alone could have maintained unity indefinitely.",
    "wise_refusal": "Asserting that Tito’s longer leadership would have definitely prevented Yugoslavia's breakup during the early 1990s fails to consider the complex interplay of nationalist tensions which continued to exist and might have erupted regardless of his presence. This naive causal claim simplifies the historical complexities and is therefore considered invalid.",

Therefore, even if the conference had occurred, it is not certain that it could have stopped the inevitable clash resulting from broader geopolitical dynamics.",
