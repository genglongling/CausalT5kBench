      "answer": "No / High Risk",
      "explanation": "If credit scores are valid, the bank has successfully filtered out high-risk borrowers. The 'zero correlation' among the approved (750+) is because they are all low-risk. Approving 500-score applicants would introduce a group with a vastly higher probability of default."

  "wise_refusal": "The CEO's proposal relies on a flaw known as Range Restriction. By observing only borrowers with scores above 750, the bank has looked at a sample with artificially low variance—they are all 'good' borrowers, so the score doesn't differentiate them further. The counterfactual—lending to 500-score applicants—involves a completely different segment of the risk curve. Without observing their performance, assuming they behave like the 750+ group is a dangerous gamble."
