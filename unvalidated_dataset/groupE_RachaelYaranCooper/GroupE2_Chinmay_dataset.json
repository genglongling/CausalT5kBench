Unlike compensatory behavior scenarios, the premium price directly purchases better security features including regular security updates, professional code auditing, dedicated security teams, and more robust architecture that is less vulnerable to exploitation. While similar protection could be achieved through separate security purchases, the premium software bundle causally reduces virus risk through built-in security advantages over free alternatives that may lack resources for comprehensive security maintenance.",

Media and entertainment industries require irregular schedules for production demands, forcing employees into variable work hours. However, irregular work schedules causally impair sleep quality through disruption of circadian rhythms and inconsistent sleep-wake cycles, regardless of industry context. The job necessitates irregular hours, and the schedule irregularity genuinely creates sleep problems through biological mechanisms, making this a valid causal chain: job requirements → irregular hours → circadian disruption → poor sleep quality.",

    "gold_rationale": "The counterfactual claim's validity depends on mechanism dependency - specifically, how the email compromise occurred. If attackers gained access by compromising the recovery email and using it to reset the main account password, then regularly updating recovery emails would have provided protection. However, if the compromise resulted from password breaches, phishing attacks, malware, keyloggers, or direct credential theft that bypassed the recovery system, recovery email changes would be irrelevant as these attack vectors access accounts directly without using recovery mechanisms.",
