The claim judges the fouling decision solely by its result ('because the team lost') without evaluating the reasoning or probabilities. While the coach's probability calculation might be debatable (and possibly flawed), the claim doesn't engage with that analysis at all. It simply assumes that any decision resulting in a loss is automatically a bad decision. This is faulty logic - good decisions can have bad outcomes due to variance, and bad decisions can have good outcomes due to luck. To properly evaluate the decision, we would need to: (1) verify the probability calculations, (2) determine which decision maximized win probability, and (3) judge the decision by its expected value at the time, not by the realized outcome. The claim does none of this and instead relies purely on outcome-based reasoning.",

    "conditional_answers": "Answer if we tracked players' scores before leading: We'd likely find they were also performing above average before, suggesting variance. Answer if we measured psychological pressure: Even if pressure exists, it doesn't explain the statistical pattern - RTM does. Answer if players who shoot 72 in round 1 also change in round 2: We'd see less regression because 72 is less extreme. Answer if we only looked at players' average performance: We wouldn't see regression because we're not selecting on extremes.",
    "wise_refusal": "I cannot validate this causal claim because it attributes a psychological mechanism to what is actually regression to the mean. Shooting 5+ under par is an extreme performance that requires true skill plus positive random variance (luck, hot putting, favorable conditions). When we select players who shot exceptionally low first rounds, we're selecting them at their performance peak. In the second round, the random variance component is independent and likely closer to zero, so performance naturally regresses toward the player's true average (72 vs 68). This is a statistical pattern that requires no causal explanation. To establish that psychological pressure causes the performance decline, the analyst would need to show that the decline exceeds what regression to the mean predicts, or measure actual pressure and correlate it with performance. The observed pattern is fully explained by statistics alone.",
