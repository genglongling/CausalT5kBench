Establishing causal primacy requires comparing effect sizes through rigorous identification strategies (natural experiments, instrumental variables, cross-country comparisons with controls), not observing parallel trends. The economist's selection reflects theoretical priors - that market forces matter more than institutions - rather than evidence from the data presented. Cross-country evidence undermines the technology/globalization explanation: some countries experienced similar technological advancement and trade openness but had much smaller inequality increases, suggesting institutional factors (unions, labor law, corporate governance) may be decisive. The data is also consistent with a deeper explanation: a political-ideological shift favoring capital that simultaneously enabled globalization, shaped technology deployment, weakened unions, and cut taxes on high earners.",

(3) Scale mismatch - economic theory predicts metro-wide supply effects over years; residents experience hyperlocal dynamics over months. Research shows that while regional housing supply does moderate prices, specific neighborhoods with new luxury construction often see local rent increases. Some zoning reforms have lowered rents primarily through expectation effects before significant construction occurred - suggesting the mechanism is more complex than simple supply-demand.

Furthermore, index funds (Z2) are mandated to own shares based on market capitalization; since firms with higher pricing power often have higher market caps, the 'common ownership' observed is a mechanical result of fund rules rather than an intervention that 'softens' competition.
